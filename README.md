The goal of this repo is to explore singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA).
    SVD and PCA are incredibly powerful tools for a data scientist and a good 
    understanding of their uses and limitations will pay dividends over oneâ€™s career. 
    SVD is often used in data reduction where the original data is transformed in a way 
    to need significantly fewer dimensions to characterize. This is incredibly helpful in machine learning 
    where the dimensionality of data is often enormous. 
    PCA is often used to identify the variance and covariance of a datset while also serving as a data reduction method.
    By understanding the structure of the data you are working with, you may be able to extract incredibly valuable features,
    allowing for interpretations which may have been missed. 
    Note: This work covers and uses the compact SVD.
	

Two datasets were sourced for this project, both from the Yale Faces
Project. A link to both can be found below:
